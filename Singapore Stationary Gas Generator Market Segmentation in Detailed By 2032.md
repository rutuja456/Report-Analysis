Overview Of Stationary Gas Generator Market

Generators are backup devices designed to provide temporary AC or DC power using the supplied fuel (gasoline, diesel, or gas). They can be used as a source of backup or emergency power for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. A typical generator is powered by a fuel engine. Portable generators are the best solutions to provide AC power for standby, non-hardwired applications. Low-end models support only a few basic home appliances. However, there are high-end portable generators that can provide backup AC power to an entire house. Apart from residential use, portable generators are widely used in commercial buildings and industrial and infrastructure sites. In short, they can be utilized wherever a grid is unavailable.
