<strong>Vagus Nerve Stimulation(VNS) Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Vagal nerve stimulation or vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a treatment method that involves delivering electrical impulses to the vagus nerve. Vegas nerve acts as a translator between gut and brain. Gut uses the vagus nerve like a walkie-talkie and translates signals via electric impulses, which called action potentials. VNS treatment is used for certain types of intractable epilepsy, depression, and others. In most common cases, overstimulation of the vagus nerve causes fainting. Vagus nerve stimulation is a procedure, which involves implantation of a device that stimulates the vagus nerve with electrical impulses. This device is normally implanted under the skin below the patient's clavicle. Lead wires from the generator are excavated up to the patient's neck and wrapped around the left vagus nerve at the carotid sheath, where it delivers electrical impulses to the nerve. After successfully implanted, the generator sends electric impulses to the vagus nerve at a regular intervals.
