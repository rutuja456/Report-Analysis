Overview Of Uninterruptible Power Supply Market

An uninterruptible power supply is electrical equipment that gives emergency power to a load when the input power source or mains power fails. An uninterruptible power supply is different from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will give near-instantaneous safety from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, super capacitors, or flywheels. The on-battery runtime of most uninterruptible power sources is relatively short but sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment. In large industrial facilities, power failures are highly detrimental for the operational efficiency. Industrial UPS systems (Uninterruptible Power Supply) can mitigate such effects with advanced functionalities and features. These extensive services include extended power back up and protection against several power quality issues.
